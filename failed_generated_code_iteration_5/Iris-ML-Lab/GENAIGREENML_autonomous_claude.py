# --- OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY ---
# 1. Model choice: NearestCentroid is the most energy-efficient classifier for this task.
#    It computes one centroid per class (O(n·d) training) and classifies via Euclidean
#    distance to centroids (O(k·d) per sample). This directly matches the project's
#    stated goal of centroid-based classification with Euclidean distance.
# 2. Preprocessing: StandardScaler normalizes features so distance-based classification
#    is not dominated by any single feature. Minimal overhead.
# 3. No ensemble, no deep learning, no heavy hyperparameter tuning — pure lightweight.
# 4. Robust CSV parsing with fallback separator, column name normalization, and
#    defensive checks ensure end-to-end execution on unknown schema variations.
# 5. Fixed random_state=
