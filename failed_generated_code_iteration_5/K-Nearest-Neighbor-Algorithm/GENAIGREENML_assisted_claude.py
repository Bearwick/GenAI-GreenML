# Optimization Summary
# - Replaced manual CSV parsing with pandas read_csv for efficient I/O with robust fallback for separator/decimal issues.
# - Replaced pure-Python Euclidean distance and KNN loop with sklearn KNeighborsClassifier using ball_tree, dramatically reducing computation.
# - Used n_jobs=-1 to parallelize neighbor search across CPU cores.
# - Normalized pixel values to [0,1] float32 to reduce memory and improve numerical stability with distance-based methods.
# - Used numpy arrays with explicit dtypes (float32/int32) to minimize memory footprint.
# - Preserved weighted distance voting (weights='distance') matching original KNN behavior.
# - Used train_test_split with stratify and fixed random seed for reproducibility (original used separate test file; we split training data since only one file is guaranteed).
# - Removed all prints, plots, file saves, and interactive inputs per requirements.
# - Single accuracy print in required format at the end.
