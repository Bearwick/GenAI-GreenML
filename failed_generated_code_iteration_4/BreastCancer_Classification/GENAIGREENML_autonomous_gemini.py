# Optimization Summary:
# 1. Model Choice: Logistic Regression was selected as it is computationally lightweight (O(n) complexity),
#    aligns with the green coding goal of minimizing CPU cycles compared to ensembles or deep learning.
# 2. Preprocessing: Used sklearn.Pipeline to ensure efficient, vectorized transformations (scaling/imputation).
# 3. Memory Efficiency: Standardized numeric types and dropped unnecessary columns (Unnamed) early.
# 4. Robustness: Implemented a column-agnostic target selection strategy based on unique value counts 
#    to handle variations in the CSV schema without manual intervention.
# 5. Convergence: Increased max_iter to 1000 to ensure convergence with the lbfgs solver on scaled data.
# 6. Fallback: Included defensive checks for empty datasets or single-class targets to ensure the 
#    script completes successfully in edge cases.
