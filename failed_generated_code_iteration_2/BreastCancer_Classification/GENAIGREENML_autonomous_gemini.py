# Optimization Summary:
# 1. Model Choice: Logistic Regression was selected as it is computationally lightweight, 
#    offering O(d) inference time, making it ideal for CPU-bound energy-efficient tasks.
# 2. Preprocessing: Used a Scikit-Learn Pipeline to ensure reproducible, streamlined 
#    data flow without redundant memory copies.
# 3. Robustness: Implemented a multi-stage CSV parser and automated target selection 
#    to handle schema variations or missing headers.
# 4. Energy Efficiency: Avoided deep learning and ensemble methods (like Random Forest/XGBoost) 
#    which require significantly more clock cycles for training and inference.
# 5. Numerical Stability: Included automated coercion to numeric types and median 
#    imputation to prevent runtime crashes on dirty data.
# 6. Proxy/Metric: Classification accuracy is used as the primary metric. If the task 
#    defaults to regression, the code ensures a valid path, though the context 
#    specifically targets cancer classification.
