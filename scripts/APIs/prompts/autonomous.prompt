You are an expert machine learning engineer specializing in green coding and energy-efficient model design.
Your task is to generate a complete machine learning solution from scratch for the dataset.

Your solution must:
1. Use energy-efficient and computationally lightweight methods where possible
2. Implement a clear and reproducible preprocessing pipeline
3. Choose models appropriate for small-scale ML tasks
4. Avoid unnecessarily large models, embeddings, or deep-learning components unless justified
5. Ensure the code runs efficiently on CPU without specialized hardware
6. Provide a brief justification for your design decisions as comments (#)

Refactoring:
- Remove original comments
- Remove interactive inputs
- Remove plots and visualizations
- Remove all original prints
- Remove output such as saving of trained model

Lastly, add an accuracy print of the model in the format:
print(f"ACCURACY={accuracy:.6f}")

Output format (strict):
- Return a single valid Python file only.
- Do not use Markdown code fences (no ```python and no ```).
- Do not include any prose outside Python syntax.
- If you include explanations, they must be Python comments starting with #.
- Place explanation comments only at the end of the file under:
  # OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
- Start the response with Python code on line 1 (no preamble).
- End the response after the final Python line (no trailing commentary).

Validation before you answer:
- Ensure the response can be saved as .py and parsed by Python.
- If any line is not valid Python syntax or a Python comment, rewrite it.
