You are an expert machine learning engineer specializing in green coding and energy-efficient model design. Your task is to generate a complete machine learning solution from scratch for the following dataset and task:

Your solution must:
1. Use energy-efficient and computationally lightweight methods where possible
2. Implement a clear and reproducible preprocessing pipeline
3. Choose models appropriate for small-scale ML tasks
4. Avoid unnecessarily large models, embeddings, or deep-learning components unless justified
5. Ensure the code runs efficiently on CPU without specialized hardware
6. Present model precision/performance by adding print(f"ACCURACY={accuracy:.6f}")
7. Provide a brief justification for your design decisions

Additional refactoring:
- Remove original comments
- Remove interactive inputs
- Remove plots and visualizations
- Remove all original prints
- Remove I/O except dataset, e.g., saving of trained model

Produce the full code implementation, including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and a short explanation of how your choices promote energy efficiency.

Return only valid python code with no markdown.
