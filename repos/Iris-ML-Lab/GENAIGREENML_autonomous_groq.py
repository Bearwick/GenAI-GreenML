# Energy‑efficient iris classification with a Nearest Centroid classifier.
# Design choices:
# 1. Use a lightweight nearest‑centroid model (no deep learning, minimal parameters).
# 2. Scale features with StandardScaler for numerical stability.
# 3. Perform an 80/20 train‑test split to evaluate generalisation without overfitting.
# 4. All computations are vectorised in NumPy/Scikit‑Learn, suitable for CPU execution.
# 5. Only a single accuracy print keeps runtime and I/O minimal.
