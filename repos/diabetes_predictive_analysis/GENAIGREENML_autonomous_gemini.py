# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# 1. Model Selection: Used a restricted Random Forest (50 trees, max depth 5) to ensure a small computational footprint without sacrificing accuracy.
# 2. Data Cleaning: Targeted zero-value replacement for physiological features (e.g., BMI, Glucose) to prevent skewed statistics.
# 3. CPU Efficiency: Forced n_jobs=1 to minimize the energy overhead associated with process spawning and multi-threading on a small dataset.
# 4. Preprocessing: Chosen Median Imputation as it is significantly more energy-efficient than iterative or K-Nearest Neighbors approaches.
# 5. Resource Management: Utilized a Pipeline to streamline data flow, reducing memory overhead by avoiding multiple intermediate data copies.
# 6. Scaling: Standardized features to improve numerical stability and ensure uniform importance across variables during the training process.
