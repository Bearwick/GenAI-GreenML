# Energy‑efficient breast cancer classification
# - Uses a lightweight Logistic Regression (liblinear solver)
# - Standard scaling applied via a Pipeline for reproducibility
# - Only the final accuracy is printed as required
# - No plots, interactive input, or large embeddings are used
# - All operations run on CPU and are computationally light
