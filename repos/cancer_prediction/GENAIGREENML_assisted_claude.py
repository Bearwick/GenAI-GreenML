# Optimization Summary
# Removed joblib imports and model/scaler saving to avoid unnecessary disk I/O and side effects.
# Removed matplotlib/seaborn imports and confusion matrix visualization to eliminate heavy unused dependencies and rendering overhead.
# Removed classification_report computation and all intermediate print/logging statements.
# Added robust CSV fallback: retries with sep=';' and decimal=',' if initial parse yields too few columns.
# Preserved identical ML pipeline: same features, same split, same scaler, same model with same random_state for reproducibility.
# Kept code minimal and modular with no redundant data structures or loops.
