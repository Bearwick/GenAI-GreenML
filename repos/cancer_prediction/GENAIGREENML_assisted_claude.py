# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# Removed unused imports (joblib, matplotlib, seaborn, classification_report, confusion_matrix)
# Removed visualization code (confusion matrix heatmap) to save computation and memory
# Removed model/scaler saving to disk to avoid unnecessary I/O
# Removed redundant prints (classification report, file save messages)
# Converted DataFrame selections to .values (numpy arrays) to reduce pandas overhead
# Removed try/except block to reduce branching overhead; file assumed present
# Core ML logic and reproducibility (random_state=42) preserved
