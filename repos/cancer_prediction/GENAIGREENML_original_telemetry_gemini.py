# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# - Removed unused imports: joblib, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn.
# - Removed original commentary and descriptive print statements.
# - Removed visualization code including confusion matrix heatmap generation.
# - Removed the try-except block around data loading to provide a clean execution flow.
# - Removed functionality for saving the trained model and scaler to disk.
# - Standardized the output to only include the required accuracy metric.
