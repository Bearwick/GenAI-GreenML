# Optimizations applied
# 1. Removed unnecessary imports and visualisation libraries to reduce memory and CPU usage.
# 2. Eliminated all intermediate DataFrames and kept only NumPy arrays for feature matrix and target vector, lowering memory footprint and speeding up matrix operations.
# 3. Converted data types to float32 for features and uint8 for labels to halve memory usage compared to default float64 and int64.
# 4. Used stratified split to maintain class balance without extra overhead.
# 5. Suppressed printing of auxiliary information, keeping only the required accuracy metric.
# 6. Avoided redundant computations: no classification reports or confusion matrices were computed.
# 7. Kept the same deterministic seeds for reproducibility.
