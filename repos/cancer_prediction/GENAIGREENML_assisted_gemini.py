# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# 1. Reduced memory footprint by using 'usecols' in pd.read_csv to only load necessary columns from disk.
# 2. Removed heavy dependencies such as matplotlib, seaborn, and joblib to minimize startup time and memory overhead.
# 3. Eliminated energy-intensive I/O operations by removing model serialization (saving) and visualization rendering.
# 4. Streamlined the processing pipeline by avoiding redundant dataframe copies and intermediate diagnostic prints.
# 5. Reduced computational cycles by stripping unnecessary metrics like classification reports and confusion matrices.
# 6. Optimized data movement by performing transformations directly on the necessary feature subset.
