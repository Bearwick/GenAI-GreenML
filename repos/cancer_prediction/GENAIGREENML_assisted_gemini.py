Applied Optimizations:
1. Memory Efficiency: Used 'usecols' in pd.read_csv to load only required columns, significantly reducing the initial memory footprint.
2. Optimized Data Types: Cast feature matrix to 'float32' and target vector to 'int8'. This reduces memory consumption and speeds up mathematical operations compared to default 64-bit types.
3. Computational Overhead: Removed heavy dependencies (matplotlib, seaborn, joblib) to reduce library loading time and memory overhead.
4. I/O Minimization: Eliminated model/scaler serialization and all visualization steps to minimize disk and CPU activity.
5. In-place Operations: Reused variables (X_train, X_test) after scaling to minimize redundant data copies in memory.
6. Faster Data Conversion: Used .to_numpy() for direct conversion to optimized NumPy arrays for scikit-learn compatibility.
