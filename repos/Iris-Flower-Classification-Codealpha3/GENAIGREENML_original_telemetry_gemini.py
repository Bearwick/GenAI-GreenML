# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# - Removed data visualization libraries (matplotlib and seaborn).
# - Removed all original comments and descriptive print statements.
# - Removed plots, confusion matrix heatmaps, and classification reports.
# - Removed cross-validation logic as it was primarily used for original print output.
# - Maintained core algorithmic logic, including model hyper-parameters and data splitting strategy.
# - Fixed the output to conform to the requested accuracy format.
