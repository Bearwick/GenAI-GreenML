# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# Removed unused imports (matplotlib, seaborn, cross_val_score, Pipeline, classification_report, confusion_matrix)
# Used usecols in read_csv to only load needed columns, avoiding loading "Id" and then dropping it
# Replaced Pipeline with direct scaler + model calls to reduce overhead
# Converted features to numpy array early with .values to avoid DataFrame overhead during fitting
# Removed cross-validation to eliminate redundant re-training (not needed for final accuracy)
# Removed all plots, prints, and saving operations as required
# Preserved original train/test split, random_state, model, and preprocessing for identical results
