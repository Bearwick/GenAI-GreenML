# Optimization Summary
# Removed seaborn/matplotlib imports and all visualization code to eliminate unnecessary computation and memory usage.
# Removed cross_val_score call which re-fitted the model 5 additional times without contributing to final accuracy output.
# Removed classification_report and confusion_matrix computations that were only used for printing.
# Removed all original print/logging statements.
# Added robust CSV parsing fallback (default then sep=';' with decimal=',').
# Added random_state=42 to LogisticRegression for reproducibility.
# Kept the same dataset, task, model, pipeline, and train/test split to preserve original behavior and accuracy.
