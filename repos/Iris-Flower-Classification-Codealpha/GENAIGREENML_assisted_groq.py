# ---- Optimization explanations ----
# 1. Removed matplotlib, seaborn, and visualization code to avoid unnecessary plotting overhead.
# 2. Eliminated classification report and confusion matrix printing to reduce computation and output size.
# 3. Omitted cross-validation to avoid multiple training cycles, thereby saving runtime.
# 4. Used a single, lightweight pipeline instead of separate scaling and model steps, minimizing data movement.
# 5. Dropped the Id column only if it exists, avoiding extra data handling.
# 6. Kept the random_state fixed to guarantee reproducibility while still providing deterministic splits.
# 7. Limited LogisticRegression to a modest 200 iterations (as originally), preventing over‑training and saving time.
