## Internship
CodeAlpha – Data Science Internship  
Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

## Objective
To build and evaluate machine learning classification models that predict
the species of Iris flowers using a given CSV dataset.

## Dataset
- Iris dataset (CSV file provided)
- Features: Sepal & Petal measurements
- Target: Species of Iris flower

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Label encoding of target variable
- Train-test split
- Model training using pipelines
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Cross-validation

## Results
All models achieved high accuracy (approximately 95%–100%) on the test dataset,
demonstrating effective classification performance.

## Conclusion
