# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# 1. Removed interactive debug print statements and progress messages.
# 2. Removed model and vectorizer persistence logic (joblib.dump).
# 3. Fixed the ML coding error where the test set was not being evaluated.
# 4. Added transformation of the test data using the fitted vectorizer and subsequent scoring to provide the required accuracy output.
# 5. Maintained the original algorithmic behavior and hyperparameters.
