# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# 1. Multi-core execution: Added n_jobs=-1 to RandomForestClassifier to utilize all available CPU cores, accelerating training and reducing energy waste from prolonged runtime.
# 2. Memory footprint reduction: Converted object columns to the 'category' dtype, which significantly reduces RAM usage and speeds up the one-hot encoding process.
# 3. Streamlined data loading: Combined byte-decoding and categorical conversion into a single pass over the dataframe columns to minimize redundant iterations.
# 4. Reduced I/O overhead: Removed all visualization, classification reports, and intermediate print statements to lower computational and logging overhead.
# 5. Efficient preprocessing: Replaced global dummy encoding with targeted type management to ensure the model pipeline uses the most efficient data structures.
