# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# 1. Algorithm Selection: Logistic Regression was chosen over Deep Learning or Ensembles. 
#    It provides high interpretability with minimal CPU cycles and memory usage, 
#    fitting the "green coding" requirement for small tabular datasets.
# 2. Convergence Efficiency: StandardScaler was applied to normalize feature scales, 
#    allowing the lbfgs optimizer to converge in fewer iterations, reducing total energy consumption.
# 3. Memory Management: Redundant columns (like the duplicate death_event) and 
#    unnecessary indices were pruned early to minimize the memory footprint of the DataFrames.
# 4. Hardware Awareness: The solution uses scikit-learn's CPU-optimized routines, 
#    avoiding the overhead of GPU initialization or complex library dependencies.
# 5. Pipeline Simplicity: Avoided complex feature engineering or high-dimensional 
#    embeddings to keep the model's carbon footprint low during both training and inference.
