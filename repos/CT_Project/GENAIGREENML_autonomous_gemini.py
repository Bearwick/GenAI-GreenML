# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# 1. Used Logistic Regression instead of Deep Learning (BERT/RNN) to minimize CO2 footprint and CPU usage.
# 2. Implemented TfidfVectorizer with a max_features limit to prevent memory bloat and high-dimensional computation.
# 3. Employed sparse matrix representations natively supported by scikit-learn to reduce RAM consumption.
# 4. Avoided complex embeddings (Word2Vec/GloVe) to bypass the need for large pre-trained model loading.
# 5. Enabled 'english' stop-word removal to decrease the number of features processed by the model.
# 6. Selected the 'lbfgs' solver for its balance between convergence speed and computational overhead.
# 7. No external heavy dependencies (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) required, ensuring low environment overhead.
