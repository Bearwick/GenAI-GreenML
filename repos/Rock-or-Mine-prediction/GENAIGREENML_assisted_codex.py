# Optimization Summary
# - Removed unused descriptive computations and logging to avoid redundant processing.
# - Used iloc slicing to minimize DataFrame copying when separating features and labels.
# - Added a robust CSV parsing fallback to handle delimiter/decimal variations with minimal retries.
# - Leveraged model.score to compute accuracy without storing intermediate predictions.
# - Set fixed random seeds for reproducible splits and training behavior.
