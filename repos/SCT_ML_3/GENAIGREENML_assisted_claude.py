# Optimization Summary
# 1. Replaced SVC(kernel="linear") with LinearSVC which uses liblinear — significantly faster for linear kernels, lower memory usage, same linear decision boundary.
# 2. Converted features to numpy array (.values) before train_test_split to avoid pandas overhead during fitting.
# 3. Removed LabelEncoder object retention since class names are not needed; encode in one line.
# 4. Removed classification_report computation — only accuracy is needed for output.
# 5. Removed all prints, plots, and artifacts except the required accuracy print.
# 6. Added robust CSV fallback parsing with sep=';' and decimal=','.
# 7. Derived label column name dynamically from actual columns rather than hardcoding.
# 8. Set random_state on model for reproducibility.
# 9. Used dual="auto" to let LinearSVC pick the most efficient solver formulation based on n_samples vs n_features.
