JUSTIFICATION FOR ENERGY-EFFICIENT DESIGN:
1. Model Choice: Logistic Regression is used because it is one of the most computationally efficient algorithms for 
   binary classification. It relies on simple dot products and a sigmoid activation, minimizing CPU cycles and 
   memory footprint compared to ensemble methods or neural networks.
2. Optimized Preprocessing: StandardScaler is used to normalize feature scales, which significantly speeds up 
   gradient convergence in the solver, reducing the total number of iterations and thus total energy consumed.
3. Computational Lightweighting: The solution utilizes scikit-learn's optimized C-based backends for matrix 
   operations. This is far more energy-efficient than high-level Python loops or complex deep learning frameworks 
   that require significant initialization overhead and memory allocation.
4. Hardware Alignment: By avoiding GPU-dependent libraries, the code operates within a low thermal design power 
   (TDP) envelope, making it suitable for edge devices or low-energy CPU environments.
