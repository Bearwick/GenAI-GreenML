# --- OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY ---
# 1. Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset: binary classification (M=malignant, B=benign).
# 2. LogisticRegression with LBFGS solver is extremely lightweight on CPU,
#    converges fast on 30-feature numeric data, and is well-suited for this
#    linearly separable dataset (~95-97% accuracy expected).
# 3. StandardScaler ensures features are on comparable scales for the linear model.
# 4. No ensemble methods or deep learning needed — logistic regression provides
#    near-optimal accuracy with minimal energy consumption.
# 5. Robust CSV parsing with fallback, column normalization, and defensive checks
#    ensure the pipeline runs end-to-end
