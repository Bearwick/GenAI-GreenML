# Optimization Summary
# - Removed all exploratory/visual steps (DataFrame displays, histogram, confusion-matrix heatmap) to avoid extra computation and rendering overhead.
# - Eliminated unused metrics (precision/recall/F1) and intermediate DataFrame construction to reduce redundant work and memory allocations.
# - Avoided extra predictions on arbitrary rows (X.iloc[[0,1,2,3]]) since they do not affect the evaluated output.
# - Added robust CSV parsing with a fallback separator/decimal strategy to prevent costly failures/retries and ensure reliable ingestion.
# - Set fixed random_state for both train/test split and MLPClassifier for reproducible, stable results.
# - Kept data as pandas/NumPy-backed structures without unnecessary copies to minimize data movement and memory footprint.
