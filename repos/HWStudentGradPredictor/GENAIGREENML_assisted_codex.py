# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# - Removed unused visualizations, exploratory outputs, and extra metric calculations to save computation.
# - Limited imports to essentials to reduce overhead.
# - Used DataFrame.pop and NumPy arrays to minimize copies and repeated conversions.
# - Set random_state for deterministic behavior and reproducible results.
# - Simplified workflow to only necessary training and evaluation steps.
