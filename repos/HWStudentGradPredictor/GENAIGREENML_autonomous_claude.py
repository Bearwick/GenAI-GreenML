# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# 1. HistGradientBoostingClassifier chosen: histogram-based gradient boosting is
#    one of the most energy-efficient and accurate methods for tabular data on CPU.
#    It uses binned features reducing memory and computation significantly vs standard GBDT.
# 2. Early stopping enabled: avoids unnecessary training iterations, saving compute time.
# 3. LabelEncoder used instead of one-hot encoding: avoids dimensionality explosion
#    for categorical features, keeping memory footprint small.
# 4. StandardScaler applied only to numeric columns: minimal preprocessing overhead.
# 5. Median imputation for missing values: robust and O(n) computation.
# 6. No deep learning used: tabular data of this scale does not benefit from neural
#    networks, and tree-based methods are both more accurate and orders of magnitude
#    more energy efficient for this task.
# 7. Moderate hyperparameters (max_depth=6, 300 iterations) balance accuracy and efficiency.
