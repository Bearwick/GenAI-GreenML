# Optimization Summary
# Removed matplotlib/seaborn imports and all plotting code to eliminate unnecessary computation and memory usage.
# Removed unused metric computations (precision, recall, f1) and intermediate DataFrames that were never consumed.
# Removed redundant predict call on X.iloc[[0,1,2,3]] which served no purpose.
# Removed all print/logging and interactive display statements.
# Used tuple instead of list for hidden_layer_sizes (avoids internal conversion).
# Added random_state to MLPClassifier for reproducibility.
# Implemented robust CSV fallback parsing based on column count check.
# Derived target column name from df.columns[-1] instead of hardcoding for robustness.
# Reduced imports to only what is needed (accuracy_score only).
