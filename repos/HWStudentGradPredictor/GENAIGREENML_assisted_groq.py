# Optimizations applied:
# 1. Added early stopping and reduced max_iter to cut training time.
# 2. Specified batch_size for efficient mini‑batch updates.
# 3. Used stratified split to keep class distribution.
# 4. Removed unnecessary imports, plots, and interactive code.
# 5. Simplified variable names and avoided extra data copies.
