# Optimization Summary
# 1. Removed heavy visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to reduce memory footprint and startup time.
# 2. Eliminated redundant computations such as intermediate predictions on the training set and multiple metric calculations (precision, recall, f1) not required for the final output.
# 3. Streamlined data loading with a robust fallback mechanism to handle different CSV formats efficiently without manual intervention.
# 4. Removed all interactive plotting, hist() calls, and data frame previews (head/tail) to minimize I/O and CPU overhead.
# 5. Fixed random_state in both splitting and the MLP model to ensure deterministic behavior and reproducibility, avoiding unnecessary variance in results.
# 6. Refactored the code into a modular structure to improve execution flow and reduce the lifecycle of large intermediate objects.
# 7. Avoided unnecessary data transformations and copies by using direct slicing and dropping.
