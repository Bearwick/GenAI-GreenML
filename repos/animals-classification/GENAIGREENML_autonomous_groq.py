# Energy‑efficient approach:
# - Use a lightweight RandomForest with few trees (50) for fast training on CPU.
# - Features are binary/ordinal, so no heavy preprocessing is required.
# - Accuracy is reported with a single print statement as requested.

# Load dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('zoo.csv')

# Separate features and target
X = dataset.iloc[:, 1:17].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, 17].values

# Train‑test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=0
)

# Model training
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, n_jobs=-1, random_state=0)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prediction and evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Output
print(f"ACCURACY={accuracy:.6f}")
