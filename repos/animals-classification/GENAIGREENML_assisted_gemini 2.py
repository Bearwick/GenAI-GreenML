OPTIMIZATIONS APPLIED:
1. Reduced Memory Footprint: Used `usecols` in `pd.read_csv` to skip the 'animal_name' column during loading, avoiding unnecessary data movement and memory allocation.
2. Library Pruning: Removed heavy visualization libraries (Seaborn, Matplotlib) which significantly reduces import time and memory overhead.
3. Eliminated Redundant Computation: Removed unused code paths such as `dataset.head()`, partial predictions `classifier.predict(X_test[15:25])`, and `classifier.score()`.
4. Efficient Metric Calculation: Replaced manual confusion matrix diagonal summation with `sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score`, which is optimized and less prone to indexing errors.
5. Streamlined Data Flow: Removed intermediate variables and loops that were not contributing to the final model performance or evaluation.
