# Optimizations applied:
# - Loaded only required numeric columns using numpy to skip the unused text column and avoid pandas overhead.
# - Read data directly as float64 to prevent internal casting during model fitting.
# - Used the model's built-in score method to compute accuracy without constructing a confusion matrix.
# - Removed unused imports, intermediate variables, and visualization steps to reduce runtime and memory use.
