# OPTIMIZATIONS APPLIED:
# 1. Removed unnecessary libraries (seaborn, matplotlib) to reduce memory overhead and initialization time.
# 2. Eliminated redundant computations, such as the unused dataset.head() call and the slice prediction X_test[15:25].
# 3. Replaced manual confusion matrix diagonal summation with sklearn's optimized accuracy_score function.
# 4. Simplified data movement by removing the creation of intermediate variables and unnecessary data slices.
# 5. Removed all visualization logic to focus computational resources on the core ML task and reduce total execution time.
