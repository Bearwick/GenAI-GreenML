# Applied Optimizations:
# 1. Library Pruning: Removed heavy visualization libraries (Seaborn, Matplotlib) to reduce memory usage and startup time.
# 2. Redundancy Removal: Eliminated unused operations like dataset.head() and intermediate slice predictions that consumed CPU cycles without contributing to results.
# 3. Computational Efficiency: Replaced manual confusion matrix indexing and arithmetic with the optimized accuracy_score function from sklearn.
# 4. Memory Optimization: Streamlined data flow to avoid creating unnecessary copies of the dataset or large intermediate arrays.
# 5. Resource Conservation: Removed plotting and rendering logic which is computationally expensive and irrelevant for model deployment/evaluation.
