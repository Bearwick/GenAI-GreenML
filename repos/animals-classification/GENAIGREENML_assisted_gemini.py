# Optimization Summary
# 1. Removed heavy visualization libraries (seaborn, matplotlib) to minimize memory footprint and energy usage.
# 2. Eliminated redundant calls such as head() display, intermediate predict() slices, and redundant score() calls.
# 3. Optimized accuracy calculation using sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score instead of manual confusion matrix summation.
# 4. Implemented robust CSV parsing with a fallback mechanism to handle different delimiters efficiently.
# 5. Removed all I/O operations (plots, logs, and unnecessary prints) to reduce computational overhead and runtime.
# 6. Used a fixed random seed in data splitting to ensure reproducibility with minimal complexity.
# 7. Simplified the workflow by removing intermediate data structures and unnecessary loops.
