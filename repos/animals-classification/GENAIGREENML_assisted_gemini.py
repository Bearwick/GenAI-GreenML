# Optimization Summary
# 1. Removed unused imports (seaborn, matplotlib, numpy) to reduce memory usage and library loading overhead.
# 2. Eliminated redundant calls such as dataset.head() and unused intermediate predictions (X_test[15:25]).
# 3. Removed heavy visualization logic and plotting dependencies (Seaborn/Matplotlib) which consume significant CPU/memory.
# 4. Streamlined accuracy calculation by using accuracy_score instead of manual confusion matrix indexing.
# 5. Implemented a robust CSV parsing fallback to handle different delimiters (comma vs semicolon) efficiently.
# 6. Minimized data movement by avoiding unnecessary slicing and temporary storage of large arrays.
# 7. Reduced computational overhead by fitting and predicting only once for the required evaluation.
