# Optimizations applied:
# 1. Removed all plotting libraries (seaborn, matplotlib) to avoid unnecessary I/O and memory usage.
# 2. Eliminated unused imports and variables to reduce memory footprint.
# 3. Switched to a linear SVM kernel, which is computationally cheaper while still providing reasonable accuracy.
# 4. Used stratified train-test split for reproducible class distribution.
# 5. Calculated accuracy directly with accuracy_score, avoiding manual confusion matrix manipulation.
