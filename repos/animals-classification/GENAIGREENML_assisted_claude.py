# Optimizations applied:
# 1. Removed unused imports (seaborn, matplotlib) to reduce memory footprint and import time.
# 2. Removed redundant .head() call and unused 'data' variable.
# 3. Removed redundant classifier.score() and classifier.predict(X_test[15:25]) calls that computed results never used.
# 4. Replaced manual confusion-matrix-based accuracy calculation with sklearn's accuracy_score for correctness and simplicity.
# 5. Removed all plots, visualizations, and commented-out code.
# 6. Kept only essential computation: load, split, train, predict, evaluate.
