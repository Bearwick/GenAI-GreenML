# Optimization Summary
# Removed unused imports: seaborn, matplotlib (no visualizations needed)
# Removed redundant .head() call that was unused
# Removed redundant classifier.score() call whose result was discarded
# Removed redundant classifier.predict(X_test[15:25]) call whose result was discarded
# Replaced manual confusion-matrix-based accuracy with sklearn.accuracy_score for correctness and simplicity
# Removed all plots and visualizations
# Removed all original prints/logging except final accuracy
# Added robust CSV fallback with sep=';' and decimal=','
# Set random_state on SVC for reproducibility
# Kept fixed random_state=0 on train_test_split as in original
