# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# 1. Model choice: RandomForestClassifier is lightweight, CPU-friendly, and effective
#    for structured/tabular data with ~68 numeric features. No deep learning needed.
# 2. Preprocessing: Simple fillna(0) and StandardScaler - minimal overhead.
# 3. Hyperparameters: 200 trees with max_depth=30 balances accuracy vs compute cost.
#    max_features="sqrt" reduces per-tree computation significantly.
# 4. n_jobs=-1 parallelizes across CPU cores for faster training without extra energy.
# 5. class_weight="balanced" handles potential label imbalance without oversampling.
# 6. No unnecessary deep learning, embeddings, or GPU dependencies.
# 7. Stratified split ensures representative class distribution in train/test sets.
