# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# 1. Model Choice: RandomForestClassifier was selected as it provides high predictive power for tabular assembly instruction data without the high energy consumption of deep learning models.
# 2. Complexity Reduction: n_estimators was restricted to 50 and max_depth to 12. This significantly reduces the number of operations and memory footprint while maintaining generalization.
# 3. Feature Scaling: StandardScaler was used to normalize instruction counts and file size metrics, ensuring the model converges faster and more reliably on CPU.
# 4. Computational Efficiency: The use of n_jobs=-1 utilizes multicore processing to reduce the total time the CPU remains in a high-power state.
# 5. Preprocessing: Simple fillna(0) and standard splitting avoids expensive iterative imputation or complex feature engineering, keeping the pipeline lightweight.
# 6. Green Design: The solution avoids specialized hardware (GPUs/TPUs) and minimizes FLOPs by using a shallow ensemble of decision trees.
