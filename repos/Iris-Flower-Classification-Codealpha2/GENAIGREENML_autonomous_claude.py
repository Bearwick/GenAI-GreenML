# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# 1. Dropped non-informative Id column to reduce unnecessary computation.
# 2. Used LabelEncoder for minimal-overhead target encoding.
# 3. StandardScaler chosen for fast, in-place feature normalization (O(n) per feature).
# 4. Logistic Regression with LBFGS solver: highly efficient for small multi-class problems,
#    converges quickly, requires no GPU, and has negligible memory footprint.
# 5. Stratified split ensures representative evaluation on this small (150-sample) dataset.
# 6. No deep learning or ensemble methods needed — Iris is linearly separable in practice,
#    making logistic regression both energy-efficient and highly accurate.
