# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# Selected required columns via indexing instead of drop() to reduce intermediate allocations and data movement.
# Set random_state for train_test_split and model to ensure reproducible, stable results across runs.
# Kept the lightweight DecisionTreeClassifier and avoided any additional preprocessing or transformations.
