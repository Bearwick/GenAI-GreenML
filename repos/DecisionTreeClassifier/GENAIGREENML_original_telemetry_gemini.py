# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# - Removed original print statements and replaced with the requested accuracy format.
# - Cleaned up whitespace and variable naming for consistency.
# - Preserved the original Decision Tree logic and train/test split ratio.
# - Ensured the code is a functional, standalone script for the provided dataset schema.
