# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# 1. Added random_state=42 to train_test_split and DecisionTreeClassifier for reproducibility
# 2. Removed unnecessary prints, plots, model saving, and interactive inputs
# 3. Kept lightweight DecisionTreeClassifier which is already efficient for this small dataset
# 4. Minimal memory footprint: no redundant intermediate structures or copies
