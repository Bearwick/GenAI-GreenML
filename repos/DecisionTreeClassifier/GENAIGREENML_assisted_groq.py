# ------------------
# Optimizations applied:
# 1. Fixed random_state ensures deterministic splits and model training, enabling reproducible results.
# 2. Removed redundant imports and unnecessary variables to reduce memory footprint.
# 3. Avoided intermediate copies by directly using pandas DataFrames; DecisionTree handles categorical data efficiently.
# 4. Eliminated interactive input, plots, and verbose prints, keeping only the final accuracy output.
# 5. Used lightweight DecisionTreeClassifier with default parameters to keep runtime minimal.
