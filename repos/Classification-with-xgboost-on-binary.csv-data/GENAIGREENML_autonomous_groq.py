# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Justification:
# 1. Logistic regression is a linear model with minimal computational cost and memory footprint,
#    making it suitable for small‑scale classification and energy‑efficient training on CPU.
# 2. One‑hot encoding with `drop='first'` removes the dummy variable trap and reduces dimensionality.
# 3. The `ColumnTransformer` ensures a clean, reproducible preprocessing pipeline without manual encoding steps.
# 4. The entire workflow avoids heavy libraries (e.g., XGBoost, deep learning frameworks) and visualizations,
#    keeping runtime and energy consumption low.
