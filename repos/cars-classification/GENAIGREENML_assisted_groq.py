# Explanation of optimizations:
# 1. Removed heavy visualization libraries (seaborn, matplotlib) and any plot code to avoid unnecessary CPU/GPU usage.
# 2. Replaced SVC (which uses kernel tricks and can be memory-intensive) with LogisticRegression, a lighter algorithm suitable for multi-class classification.
# 3. Simplified preprocessing by directly converting necessary columns to numeric in a single step and dropping NaNs once.
# 4. Utilized a pipeline combining StandardScaler and LogisticRegression to eliminate intermediate data structures and ensure consistent scaling during training and inference.
# 5. Specified `random_state` and `stratify` in train_test_split for reproducibility and balanced class distribution.
# 6. Set `n_jobs=-1` to allow parallelism where beneficial, but since LogisticRegression is relatively lightweight, this keeps overhead minimal.
# 7. Saved the trained model using joblib for efficient persistence and quick loading in future runs.
# 8. Omitted any prints or interactive inputs, keeping runtime focused on core computation.
