"""
JUSTIFICATION:
The original implementation used manual gradient descent with 190,500 iterations, which is extremely energy-inefficient due to high CPU cycle consumption and slow convergence in Python's interpreted loop. 
This solution improves efficiency by:
1. Feature Scaling: Using StandardScaler ensures the optimization surface is well-conditioned, allowing for faster convergence.
2. Optimized Solver: Utilizing Scikit-learn's LogisticRegression with the 'lbfgs' solver (implemented in C) significantly reduces the number of iterations and time to reach the global minimum.
3. Resource Management: Avoiding deep learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow for a small 30-feature dataset minimizes the energy overhead of initializing large framework environments.
4. Deterministic Preprocessing: A simple train/test split and scaling pipeline minimizes memory footprint.
