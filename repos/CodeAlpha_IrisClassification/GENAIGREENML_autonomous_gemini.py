# Optimization Summary:
# 1. Model Selection: Logistic Regression was chosen over ensembles or deep learning. It provides 
#    high interpretability and near-zero training latency on small datasets like Iris, 
#    significantly reducing the carbon footprint compared to hyperparameter-heavy models.
# 2. Solver: Used 'lbfgs' which is memory-efficient and optimized for multiclass problems 
#    without requiring the overhead of 'liblinear' for small-to-medium datasets.
# 3. Pipeline Design: Used sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline to minimize redundant data transformations 
#    and ensure memory is freed efficiently between stages.
# 4. Data Handling: Implemented robust column normalization and automated feature selection 
#    to handle variations in CSV formatting without manual intervention or heavy regex.
# 5. Resource Management: Avoided plotting libraries (Seaborn/Matplotlib) in the execution 
#    flow to minimize CPU cycles and dependency overhead.
# 6. Preprocessing: Selected 'median' imputer and 'StandardScaler' as computationally 
#    inexpensive methods (O(n log n) and O(n) respectively) compared to iterative imputers.
# 7. Fallback Logic: Included defensive checks for single-class targets and empty datasets 
#    to ensure the process exits gracefully without wasting cycles on failed training.
