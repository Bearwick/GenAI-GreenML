# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
# 1. Logistic Regression chosen: extremely lightweight, fast on CPU, and well-suited
#    for the Iris dataset which is linearly separable in most feature dimensions.
# 2. StandardScaler used for numerical stability and faster convergence of LBFGS solver.
# 3. No deep learning or complex ensembles needed — Iris has only 150 samples and 4 features.
# 4. LabelEncoder is minimal overhead for 3-class encoding.
# 5. Stratified split ensures balanced class representation in train/test sets.
# 6. Total energy footprint is negligible: single linear model, no GPU, no grid search.
