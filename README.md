# GenAI-GreenML

**GenAI-GreenML** is an open-source dataset consisting of curated machine learning repositories collected for research on generative artificial intelligence and sustainable software development. The dataset includes 100 small-scale (<500 MB) GitHub projects focused on tabular and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Each repository contains both source code and datasets that enable reproducible experiments on model performance, energy consumption, and green coding practices.

This dataset was developed as part of a master’s thesis at the **Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)**, investigating how large language models (LLMs) can assist in producing more energy-efficient machine learning code.
